Some tweaks to AcademicMarkdown for Sublime Text

## Description

- Changed background color for easier reading
- Used color highlighting for italics since Sublime Text cannot render italics in non-monospaced fonts (a "feature", not a bug)
- Added syntax definitions and highlighting for footnotes ("^[]")
